# Infinite Scroll

Implement the JavaScript infinite scroll feature.
The page will display a list of items that come from an API. By default, it shows n items.
If you scroll down to the bottom of the page, the web application will display a loading indicator. In addition, itâ€™ll call the API to fetch more items and append them to the current list.
